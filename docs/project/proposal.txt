Hi Tal,
We would like to submit our paper choice for the final project.
Paper: "Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning of Audio Spectrogram Transformers" (Cappellazzo et al., 2024) 
Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03694
Project Specs:
Task: Environmental Sound Classification.
Dataset: ESC-50 (50 classes, 2,000 clips, ~600MB).
Model: Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) (Pre-trained on ImageNet/AudioSet).
Implementation Plan:
Architecture: We will implement the paper's novel "Conformer Adapter" modules and inject them into the frozen AST backbone .
Training: We will write the training script to fine-tune these adapter parameters (PETL) while keeping the backbone frozen, ensuring feasibility on standard compute.
